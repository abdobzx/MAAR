# Multi-Agent RAG System (MAR-RAG)

## üß† Overview

This project implements a **Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAR-RAG)** system using a microservices architecture.

User queries are processed by a central **Query Coordinator**, which delegates tasks to intelligent agents such as retrieval, generation, synthesis, or domain-specific services (e.g., ThreatIntel). The response includes a dynamic list of agents involved for traceability.

---

## üìê System Architecture

The system is composed of the following layers:

### 1. **API & Load Balancing Layer**
- **API Gateway (Kong/Nginx)**: Entry point for client queries.
- **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**: Distributes traffic to internal services.

### 2. **Core Microservices (Agents)**
- `QueryCoordinatorService`: Orchestrates the workflow.
- `QueryAgentService`: Analyzes and classifies queries.
- `RetrievalAgentService`: Fetches relevant documents via embeddings.
- `ResponseGenerationAgentService`: Uses an LLM to generate answers.
- `ContextSynthesisAgentService`: Merges session or contextual info when needed.

### 3. **Supporting Services**
- `Vector Database (ChromaDB)`
- `LLM Service (Ollama/Llama2)`
- `Embedding Service (SentenceTransformers)`
- `Cache Service (Redis)`
- `Authentication Service (OAuth2)`
- `Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)`
- `Logging (ELK Stack)`
- `Config Management (Consul)`

### 4. **Data Layer**
- `Document Storage (MinIO/S3)`
- `Metadata DB (PostgreSQL)`
- `Vector Index (Faiss/Annoy)`
- `Session Store (Redis Cluster)`

### 5. **Infrastructure**
- Containerized with **Docker**
- Managed with **Kubernetes**
- Secured and observed via **Istio Service Mesh**

## üîÅ Dynamic Agent Involvement

Each query results in a custom list of agents being called based on the query type.

### ‚úÖ Examples

#### Example A: Simple Factual Query
```json
"agents_involved": ["QueryAgent", "RetrieverAgent", "ResponseGenerationAgent"]
Example B: Cybersecurity Question
json
Copier
Modifier
"agents_involved": ["ThreatIntelAgent", "RetrieverAgent", "SecurityLLM"]
Example C: Multi-turn Chat / Contextual
json
Copier
Modifier
"agents_involved": ["RetrieverAgent", "ContextSynthesisAgent", "LLM"]
Example D: Pre-embedded Domain Retrieval
json
Copier
Modifier
"agents_involved": ["QueryAgent", "VectorDBService", "LLM"]
The "agents_involved" field in the API response is generated dynamically by the QueryCoordinatorService depending on:

Query intent

Available context

Required domain knowledge

System health and service availability
