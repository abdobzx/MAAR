# üöÄ Multi-Agent RAG System (MAR-RAG)

## üß† Overview

**MAR-RAG (Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is a microservice-based system designed for intelligent query processing. It leverages a dynamic set of autonomous agents‚Äîincluding retrievers, language models, and domain-specific services‚Äîto deliver high-quality, context-aware answers.

A central **Query Coordinator** orchestrates workflows and dynamically determines which agents to involve based on query intent, user context, and system state.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The MAR-RAG system is modular and horizontally scalable, consisting of five main layers:

### 1. **API & Load Balancing**

* **API Gateway** (Kong or Nginx): Manages incoming queries and routes them securely.
* **Load Balancer** (HAProxy): Ensures high availability and traffic distribution.

### 2. **Core Agents**

* `QueryCoordinatorService`: Central brain that routes tasks to agents.
* `QueryAgentService`: Parses and classifies incoming queries.
* `RetrievalAgentService`: Embedding-based document retriever.
* `ResponseGenerationAgentService`: Uses LLMs to generate natural language responses.
* `ContextSynthesisAgentService`: Adds memory and multi-turn context understanding.

### 3. **Supporting Services**

* **Vector DB**: `ChromaDB` or `Faiss` for similarity search.
* **LLM Backend**: `Ollama`, `LLaMA2`, or other open models.
* **Embedding Service**: SentenceTransformers-based encoding.
* **Cache Layer**: Redis for session and context storage.
* **Authentication**: OAuth2.
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana.
* **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
* **Configuration Management**: Consul.

### 4. **Data Layer**

* **Object Storage**: MinIO or AWS S3 for document storage.
* **Metadata DB**: PostgreSQL.
* **Vector Index**: Faiss/Annoy.
* **Session Store**: Redis Cluster.

### 5. **Infrastructure**

* Containerized with **Docker**.
* Orchestrated using **Kubernetes**.
* Secured and observable through **Istio Service Mesh**.

## üîÅ Dynamic Agent Involvement

For every query, the `QueryCoordinatorService` dynamically selects agents based on:

* üß† Query intent
* üìö Available context
* üß© Domain knowledge
* ‚öôÔ∏è Service availability and health

### Agent Involvement Examples

| Scenario                  | Agents Involved                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple factual query      | `["QueryAgent", "RetrieverAgent", "ResponseGenerationAgent"]` |
| Cybersecurity domain      | `["ThreatIntelAgent", "RetrieverAgent", "SecurityLLM"]`       |
| Multi-turn conversation   | `["RetrieverAgent", "ContextSynthesisAgent", "LLM"]`          |
| Domain-specific retrieval | `["QueryAgent", "VectorDBService", "LLM"]`                    |
